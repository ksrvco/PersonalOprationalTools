# PersonalOprationalTools
In this repository, I put some of the tools that I use in operational environments so that I can have them as a personal archive and easily access them, and also that if these tools are useful for someone, they can easily use them. to do These tools are coded by myself with bash script. I am very interested in Bash Script and I believe that many things can be done with Bash Script at the server level and Linux systems. These tools are often in the field of server security hardening and security-focused tools.

This tools coded and tested for debian based linux servers and systems.

These tools are small, but they are able to have better outputs in operational environments. Also, these tools are open source and it is possible for anyone to complete them and add more features to them. I myself try to expand them when I have free time because it is one of my interests.
